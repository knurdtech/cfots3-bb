Here at CrossFit OTS3 we try to keep our memberships pretty simple.  We want it to be as easy as possible to fit your schedule and needs.  Therefore, we offer an unlimited monthly schedule in which you can drop in to any class on the schedule as many times per week as you would like once you have completed the On-Ramp program.

We do not offer an initial month-to-month pricing. You have to commit to your first 3 months of training, or we cannot offer you results, and you cannot expect them.  Your health is something to commit to.  We are not looking for people who want fast results, but people that are committed. We are looking for people who want to be a part of a community filled with people that are pushing themselves to be better everyday and understand that fitness is a journey, and there is no destination.

## The On-Ramp Program

*This Program must be taken by all new clients.*

On-Ramp will help newcomers better understand the philosophy and methodology of CrossFit as well as the functional movements.  On-Ramp includes: Seven 1-2 hour sessions with a CrossFit OTS3 trainer, measurements, weight, and a picture will be taken on your first day.

The On-Ramp program is included in your regular membership purchase price.

You must attend On-Ramps 1-4 before you can go to regular class. On-Ramp 5-7 is also required and must be completed in the weeks that follow.  However if you have completed On-Ramp 1-4 you can still attend regular class but this will limit you to
