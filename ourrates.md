# Rates

CrossFit OTS3 is a coaching facility, not a typical gym that you walk into and use on your own. The only time our members come in is during scheduled sessions when our coaches are running classes.

We have created an environment conducive to empowering you to choose the life you want to lead. This is not a place where we keep machines for you to use – this is a place where we help you turn your body and mind into a highly functional and efficient machine.

We will teach you skills, habits, and nutritional knowledge you will need to achieve revolutionary results and sustain a lifetime of fitness. Having said that, membership is going to be much more than a month at your usual “gym”… and much less expensive than hours of personal training at your current gym.

Military, Law Enforcement, Fire Department, and First Responders Discount

We’re very supportive of people who put their lives at risk to protect and serve. This training can mean the difference between life and death, and it’s our goal to always make it affordable for them. Military, fire department, law enforcement personnel, and first responders (EMT's) get 15% off any membership as our way of saying “thank you for your service”.
