title: Paleo Lifestyle
---
The Paleo Diet is based upon eating wholesome, contemporary foods from the food groups our hunter-gatherer ancestors would have thrived on during the Paleolithic era, the time period from about 2.6 million years ago to the beginning of the agricultural revolution, about 10,000 years ago. These foods include fresh meats (preferably grass-produced or free-ranging beef, pork, lamb, poultry, and game meat, if you can get it), fish, seafood, fresh fruits, vegetables, seeds, nuts, and healthful oils (olive, coconut, avocado, macadamia, walnut and flaxseed). Dairy products, cereal grains, legumes, refined sugars and processed foods were not part of our ancestral menu.

Decades of research by Dr. Loren Cordain and his scientific colleagues demonstrate that hunter-gatherers typically were free from the chronic illnesses and diseases that are epidemic in Western populations, including:

* Obesity
* Cardiovascular disease (heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, atherosclerosis)
* Type 2 diabetes
* Cancer
* Autoimmune diseases (multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohnâ€™s disease, ulcerative colitis, etc.)
* Osteoporosis
* Acne
* Myopia (nearsightedness), macular degeneration, glaucoma
* Varicose veins, hemorrhoids, diverticulosis, gastric reflux
* Gout

And many, many more.
