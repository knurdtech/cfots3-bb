TheCrossFitdietary prescription is as follows:

1. Protein should be lean and varied and account for about 30% of your total caloric load.
2. Carbohydrates should be predominantly low-glycemic and account for about 40% of your total caloric load.
3. Fat should be predominantly monounsaturated and account for about 30% of your total caloric load.
4. Calories should be set at between .7 and 1.0 grams of protein per pound of lean body mass depending on your activity level. The .7 figure is for moderate daily workout loads and the 1.0 figure is for the hardcore athlete.
