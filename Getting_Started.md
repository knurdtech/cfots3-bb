# Getting Started

Are you Interested? It’s really easy to get started. Anyone can do this.  You’ve already taken some time to read about us.   Maybe you’re just not sure you believe it, or not sure it’ll “feel” right in the gym. That’s perfectly understandable. Come on by and give it a try – nothing we say will make much sense until you do. 
 
Depending on your comfort level, we can schedule an individual fitness evaluation for you (or you and a friend!) so that you can meet the coaches, learn what we do here at CrossFit OTS3, share your goals and concerns, and find a membership plan that works for you. If you’re all ready to rock and roll, we could also bring you in for a quick orientation and let you try a free group workout instead.

Just send an email to <jason@crossfitots3.com>, give me a call, or fill out our web contact form below! We’ll be glad to get you started today.
